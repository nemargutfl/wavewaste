# Wave Waste
----
### Description and Objective

This web map depicts three datasets related to plastic waste and pollution in the ocean. These datasets include: Plastic waste emitted into the ocean, plastic waste generation, and plastic waste exports. Each of these datasets are based on amounts generated from each country per capita. Color Brewer was used for the web map's color schemes. Each dataset uses a different color scheme, with values shown in the legend or if a country is hovered over with the mouse. Countries that lack data are gray. 
Plastic pollution has been on a rapid rise in the past few decades. As repoted in a [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ocean-pollution-plastic-particles-microplastic-unprecedented-level-scientists-warn/) article, there is an estimated 171 trillion plastic particles polluting the world's oceans. The objective of this map with multiple datasets is to give a spatial sense of where these issues are most prominent, and to raise awareness for this issue. Overall, this project seeks to work towards a cleaner ocean and planet.
